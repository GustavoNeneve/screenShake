# screenShake
Simple screen/camera shake script for use in Unity. Contains presets for weak, medium and strong shakes as well as the ability to customise the magnitude and duration of shakes exactly. Uses the singleton pattern. Hope it helps somebody!

Check out the demo scene for an example of how it works, but it is safe to delete everything inside the Screen Shake Demo folder once you no longer need the demo.
